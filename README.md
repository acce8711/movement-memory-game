# Colour Detection Memory Game

I worked on this project for my sensor interactions class, using OpenFrameworks to create a movement memory game. I created a movement memory game where users pick two colors for their webcam to detect. Then, they're shown a movement pattern to memorize and need to mimic it using the tracked colored objects. The game contains several levels and detects collisions between objects to move onto the next level.
